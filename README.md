## Natural Language SQL Project

In this project you will design a database and create a natural language interface to it using AI.

### Build

- Design a database! If you have a hard time coming up with an idea of what to model, maybe try one of these (restaurant, university, hair salon, system for tracking pianos on campus, vending machines, etc..)

- Build an app that users can use plain words to ask questions and get answers in plain words using data from your database!

- Your app will take questions, send them to GPT with your schema, get a SQL syntax, use the SQL to query your database, send the resulting data back to GPT, get a natural language answer and provide it back to the user.
